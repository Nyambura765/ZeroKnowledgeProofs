# ZERO-KNOWLEDGE PROOFS (ZKPS)

ZKPs are cryptographic methods that let one party (the prover) prove a statement's validity to another (the verifier) without revealing any additional information. In blockchain, ZKPs are used to verify transactions without exposing details like account balances or recipient addresses. This approach ensures privacy and security while maintaining the network's integrity. The verifier learns nothing about why the statement is true—only that it is true.

An example would be proving you're over 18 without revealing your date of birth.

## Analogy to Explain ZKPs

**The "Ali Baba Cave" Analogy (Classic):** Peggy (Prover) wants to prove to Victor (Verifier) that she knows the secret word to open a magic door in a cave. The cave has two entrances, A and B, and a magic door connecting them inside.

### Breakdown of the Analogy

#### The Setup

- Imagine a cave shaped like the letter "P"
- Two separate entrances: Path A and Path B
- Inside the cave, the paths meet at a dead end
- Between the dead end and the "loop" is a **magic door** that only opens if you say the secret word
- If you know the secret word, you can travel freely between both sides
- If you don't know it, you're stuck on whichever side you entered from

#### The Players

- **Peggy (Prover):** Claims she knows the secret word
- **Victor (Verifier):** Wants proof but doesn't want to learn the secret word

#### The Process - Round by Round

**Step 1: Peggy's Secret Choice**
- Victor waits outside where he can't see the entrances
- Peggy secretly chooses to enter through either Path A or Path B
- Victor has no idea which path she took

**Step 2: Victor's Random Challenge**
- Victor approaches the cave entrances
- He randomly shouts: "Come out through Path A!" or "Come out through Path B!"
- This is completely random - he has no knowledge of where Peggy entered

**Step 3: Peggy's Response**
- **If Peggy knows the secret word:**
  - She can always comply with Victor's request
  - Entered A but Victor wants B? She uses the magic door to cross over
  - Entered B but Victor wants A? She uses the magic door to cross over

- **If Peggy doesn't know the secret word:**
  - She can only exit where she entered
  - 50% chance Victor's random choice matches her entrance (she gets lucky)
  - 50% chance she's caught and can't comply

### Why This Proves Knowledge

- **After One Round:** 50% chance a faker could succeed by luck
- **After Two Rounds:** 25% chance (0.5²) a faker could succeed twice by luck
- **After Ten Rounds:** 0.1% chance (0.5¹⁰) a faker could succeed by pure luck
- **After Twenty Rounds:** 0.0001% chance - essentially impossible

### The Zero-Knowledge Magic

**What Victor Learns:**
- Peggy almost certainly knows the secret word
- The probability she's faking approaches zero

**What Victor Doesn't Learn:**
- The actual secret word
- Which entrance Peggy used each time
- Any information that would help him open the door himself

**Why It's Secure:**
- Victor's challenges are random, so Peggy can't predict them
- Victor never sees Peggy use the magic door
- The only explanation for consistent success is genuine knowledge

## KEY TERMINOLOGIES
1. Prover: The party trying to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing it.
2. Verifier: The party checking the validity of the proof.
3. Claim or Statement : An assertion about some secret information. 
- **Example**:"I know the password that unlocks this account
4. Inputs: These are data values that the claim is about. Inputs are divided into two categories
1. Private inputs (witness) :This is the secret informatio that the prover uses to generate the proof and must not be revealed to the verifier. A witness is only known to the prover.
- **Example**: The actual date of birth or the actual password string.
2. Public inputs: These are values known to both the prover and the verifier.These information defines the specific instance of the problem or the statement being proved.
-**Example**: The current date and the age threshold or the username or account ID for which the password is being verified.
5. Constraints: These are mathematical conditions that must be satisfied for the claim to be considered true. 
-**Exmaple**: To prove someone is over a certain age ie 18;
   private input(witness):birthdate
   public input: current date and the age threshold ie 21
   constraint: (current_date - birth_date) >= age_threshold
6. Circuit: It is a comprehensive system or collection of all constraints, that when collectively satisfied,confirm the validity of the prover's overall claim.
**structure**
Input Wires: These channels transport both confidential (private) and openly available (public) data into the computational circuit as starting values.
Intermediate Wires: These pathways transmit calculated values that are generated during the internal processing stages of the circuit computation.
Output Wires: These final channels deliver the computational results, which are automatically validated against the defined constraint requirements.
Gates: They perform operations (addition, multiplication)
-**Example**: Proving knowledge of x such that x² + 3x + 2 = 0
Input: x (private)
Gate 1: x² (multiplication gate)
Gate 2: 3x (multiplication by constant)
Gate 3: x² + 3x (addition gate)
Gate 4: x² + 3x + 2 (addition gate)
Output: 0 (public constraint)

## TYPES OF ZKPs
ZKPs can be categorized into two main types based on the communictaion pattern between the prover and the verifier
1. Interactive ZKPs  (IZK): They require multiple rounds of communictaion and responses between the prover and the verifier.
 **Communication Pattern**
Multiple rounds of back-and-forth communication
Verifier sends random challenges
Prover responds to each challenge
Process continues until verifier is convinced
An example would be the Alibaba's cave analogy.

2. Non-Interactive ZKPs(NIZK): Only single message is sent to the verifier and the verifier can check the proof independently since it is public. Examples of NIZK include zkSNARKS and zkSTARKS.
**Communication Pattern**
-Single message from prover to verifier
-No back-and-forth communication needed
-Verifier can check the proof independently

### Advantages of IZK
-Often simpler to design and analyze
-Can achieve perfect zero-knowledge
-Don't require trusted setup in many cases
-More flexible for complex statements

### Disadvantages of IZK
-Require synchronous communication
-Not suitable for blockchain or asynchronous environments
-Verifier must be online and actively participating
-Multiple rounds increase latency

### Advantages of NIZK
-Single proof can be verified by anyone, anytime
-Perfect for blockchain and distributed systems
-Can be stored and verified later
-Enable scalable verification

### Disadvantages of NIZK
-Often require stronger assumptions (like trusted setup)
-More complex cryptographic constructions
-May have larger proof sizes or slower proving times
-Harder to achieve perfect zero-knowledge 

## Use Cases of ZKPs
**Zero-Knowledge Proofs Use Cases**

**Blockchain Applications:**

• **Privacy-Preserving Transactions** - Hide sender, receiver, and transaction amounts while maintaining network verification (Zcash, Monero, Aztec Network)

• **Identity Verification & Management** - Prove personal attributes (age, citizenship, credentials) without revealing underlying sensitive data

• **Private Smart Contract Execution** - Keep contract inputs, state changes, or logic private while ensuring correct execution
